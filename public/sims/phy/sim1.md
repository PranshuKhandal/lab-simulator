# Photoelectric Effect

## Aim

  1. To understand the phenomenon Photoelectric effect as a whole.
  2. To draw kinetic energy of photoelectrons as a function of frequency of  incident radiation.
  3. To determine the Planck's constant from kinetic energy versus frequency graph.
  4. To plot a graph connecting photocurrent and applied potential.
  5. To determine the stopping potential from the photocurrent versus applied potential graph.

## Theory

During his experiments on electromagnetic radiation (to demonstrate light consists of e-m waves), Hertz noticed a spark between the two metallic balls when a high frequency radiation incident on it. This is called photoelectric effect. Photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiations having sufficient frequency incident on certain metal surfaces. We call the emitted electrons as photoelectrons and the current they constitute as photocurrent. The phenomenon was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1880 and explained by Albert Einstein in 1905 using Max Planck's quantum theory of light. As the first experiment which demonstrated the quantum theory of energy levels, photoelectric effect experiment is of great historical importance.
